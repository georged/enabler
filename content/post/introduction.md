![CRM Tipster](/img/tip64.png#floatright)Hi there, you may remember me from my appearances on https://crmtipoftheday.com and https://crm.audio. Over the years these became [somewhat] recognisable brands in our small but tight-knit ~~CRM~~ ~~Dynamics 365 CE~~ Power Platform community. We have pins, buttons, and stickers to prove it.

I've been asked a few times to share what's involved in building a *brand* like this. It's time to tell the story.

## One to one

For the first time I dipped my toes into CRM pond around CRM 3.0. I liked what I saw but there were gaps. In the product itself, in the documentation, and the best practices. Cue [CRM 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM#Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_4.0.0 "CRM 4.0 History on Wikipedia"), released in December 2007. It introduced multi-tenancy (making hosting a reality), added multi-lingual and multi-currency capabilities, introduced plugin model alongside with the Dynamic Entity concept, to name but a few. By that time, I was a convert. Adoption was growing, and community started to form around it. 

How did you participate in the community activities back in 2007? Newsgroups. Download new posts, write the replies before anyone else does, upload back. Inspired by the legendary Michael HÃ¶hne from Stunnware (filtered lookup for CRM 4, anyone?), I was all over it and loved it.

My MVP award email landed directly into spam folder (as they continue to this day) in July 2008. I was not expecting it, I was busy watching US Open. In fact, I didn't know much about MVP program at all, I was just doing what I enjoyed, mostly late at night when the family was asleep. Those were *lonely* times, but the feeling of genderneutralhood was growing with every single reply marked as an answer. 

## One to many

Roll forward couple years to [CRM 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM#Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_2011 "CRM 2011 on Wikipedia") which was a breakthrough from the technical architecture point of view. 9 years on, we still can't let go SOAP interfaces. Newsgroups/forums became a speed dating game.

> Read the SDK, dear

That was the most common answer on forums. It was time to move on. 

Did I mention that the product documentation ~~sucked~~ was not very good? Surely, *we* can do better. I'm not convinced that we did a better job but, boy|girl, we gave it a shot. [Microsoft Dynamics CRM Overview](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/microsoft-dynamics-crm-overview.aspx) was the first ever CRM article published on TechNet Wiki in March 2011. 

When we started, I exercised whatever was there of my influence, and even applied, from time to time, the art of passively aggressive persuasion. But what is the point of having an MVP status if you can't wheel it out when you have a Wiki to maintain? In the end, it took a handful of dedicated moderators and couple years before we could walk away and let Wiki continue as a community effort.

What was different this time is that, what started as a single article from an individual, ended up as a *collaborative community* creation.

On one sunny (potentially) afternoon (maybe) I was searching for something exciting to do.

It's not a mountain peak it's a journey
