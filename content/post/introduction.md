Hi there, you may remember me from the appearances on https://crmtipoftheday.com and https://crm.audio. Over the years these became [somewhat] recognisable brands in our small but tight-knit ~~CRM~~ ~~Dynamics 365 CE~~ Power Platform community. We have pins, buttons, and stickers to prove it.

I've been asked a few times to share what's involved in building a *brand* like this. It's time to tell the story.

## The Brand

What did we build over the last six years?

### CRM Tip of the Day
<img src="/img/tip.png#floatleft" width="128px">
<ul style="display:block;float:left;width:75%;">
<li>1,298 tips and counting</li>
<li>70-80K page views / month</li>
<li>3K Twitter followers</li>
<li>750 Facebook followers</li>
<li>Apple News - who knows</li>
</ul><div style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>
###  CRM Audio
<img src="/img/crm-audio-channels.png#floatleft" width="128px">
<ul style="display:block;float:left;width:75%">
<li>Total of 11 shows and one master feed that includes all shows</li>
<li>Each episode has 800-1,000 downloads within 30 days</li>
<li>20,000-25,000 downloads per month in total</li>
<li>~400gb downloaded per month</li>
</ul><div style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>
### CRM Tip of the Day Videos

Our YouTube channel, https://youtube.com/crmtipoftheday, is a special case.

* 5K subscribers
* Average view time is just over 4 min. For the videos that are under 10 min long, that's **a lot**.
* 2M minutes watched. To put it in perspective, it's equivalent to over 33K hours. Minimum US wage is $7.25 so it'd be fair to assume that the viewers are paid at least $30/hour. Which translates to $1M.

> Our viewers spent over $1,000,000 watching Derik Bormann videos. 

Which makes this screenshot particularly upsetting.

It's a team success but it's not always been this way.

## One to one

For the first time I dipped my toes into CRM pond around CRM 3.0. I liked what I saw but there were gaps. In the product itself, in the documentation, and the best practices. Cue [CRM 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM#Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_4.0.0 "CRM 4.0 History on Wikipedia"), released in December 2007. It introduced multi-tenancy (making hosting a reality), added multi-lingual and multi-currency capabilities, introduced plugin model alongside with the Dynamic Entity concept, to name but a few. By that time, I was a convert. Adoption was growing, and community started to form around it. 

How did you participate in the community activities back in 2007? Newsgroups. Download new posts, write the replies before anyone else does, upload back. Inspired by the legendary Michael Höhne from Stunnware (filtered lookup for CRM 4, anyone?), I was all over it and loved it.

My MVP award email landed directly into spam folder (as they continue to this day) in July 2008. I was not expecting it, I was busy watching US Open. In fact, I didn't know much about MVP program at all, I was just doing what I enjoyed, mostly late at night when the family was asleep. Those were *lonely* times, but the feeling of *nongenderspecifichood* was growing with every single reply marked as an answer.

Doing it solo is fine, it really depends on a personality. Consistency, perseverance, and active engagement are the keys.{{% /notice %}}

## One to many

Roll forward couple years to [CRM 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM#Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_2011 "CRM 2011 on Wikipedia") which was a breakthrough from the technical architecture point of view. 9 years on, we still can't let go SOAP interfaces. Newsgroups/forums became a speed dating game.

> Read the SDK, dear.

> Please mark this post as an answer.

That was the most common answer on forums. It was time to move on. 

Did I mention that the product documentation ~~sucked~~ was not very good? Surely, *we* can do better. I'm not convinced that we did a better job but, boy|girl, we gave it a shot. [Microsoft Dynamics CRM Overview](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/microsoft-dynamics-crm-overview.aspx) was the first ever CRM article published on TechNet Wiki in March 2011. By 2014 we've had over 150 articles about all things CRM. That's not even counting translations.

When we started, I exercised whatever was there of my influence. I even applied, from time to time, the art of passively aggressive persuasion. What is the point of having an MVP status if you can't wheel it out when you have a Wiki to maintain? In the end, it took a handful of dedicated moderators[^1] and couple years before we could walk away and let Wiki continue as a community effort. In retrospective, there was even more to it.

{{< blockquote author="Joel Lindstrom" >}}Looking at my posts, the wiki was crm tip of the day before tip of the day{{< /blockquote >}}

What was different from my previous experience is that, what started as a single article from an individual, ended up as a *collaborative community* creation. 

{{% notice tip Lesson learned %}}
Starting something new that has a very broad reach, and engaging the community could be very rewarding. Prepare to negotiate and convince. **Prepare to let your child go at some point**.{{% /notice %}}

But those unlocked achievements are going to stay with you forever or until TechNet is taken down, whichever comes first. In 2019, we're still going strong with CRM 2011 guide!

## Many to many

Microsoft lifted the game and, by the time [CRM 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM#Microsoft_Dynamics_CRM_2013 "CRM 2013 on Wikipedia") was released, documentation has improved to the point that made Wiki if not obsolete then, to a degree, redundant. And out of date. Nobody wanted to maintain documentation on the product that kept changing UX and navigation from vertical to horizontal and back every 2 years. What now? 

I surely didn't want to repeat my lonely days. On one [potentially] sunny [perhaps] afternoon I was soul-searching for something new and exciting to do. I believe I was eating fish'n'chips and poking the keyboard with my greasy finger when I came across https://office365tipoftheday.com/. What a great idea! 

By that time I knew that doing something on a regular basis is a huge if not impossible undertaking.

> Let's do CRM tips every freaking day! As a crowd!

That's what I told my fellow MVPs. What I didn't realise (nor, to my defence, did anyone else) is that the Office folks did a tip of *a* day. Like any day. Like once a month. Lucky for me, [Joel Lindstrom](https://twitter.com/joellindstrom) and [Jerry Weinstock](https://twitter.com/crminnovation) took the bait. We figured that if every one of us did on average 1&nbsp;2/3 tips per week, we are all set. 

{{< tweet 395881597662015489 >}}

I have no idea how did we manage to survive first few months but once we ticked over a hundred, we just had to keep going.  

[Shawn Tabor](https://twitter.com/crmhobbit) briefly ventured into the tipping but soon figured out that he'd rather talk than write. Joel and I decided that other podcasts were boring and, since we talk a lot anyway, hello, CRM Audio.

[Derik Bormann](https://twitter.com/derik_bormann) was happy to move the mouse while talking and https://youtube.com/crmtipoftheday was born. If you take a look at the YouTube stats above you'd notice that we didn't have much traction for two years. That's 2 years of making the videos **weekly**. Did I mention that patience and perseverance are the keys?

And the rest is history. 

### Keep going?

> … I don't really have time to read all the CRM blogposts about the new stuff. Also, I'm the only CRM specialist in an organization of 350. You guys not only keep me up to date, but thanks to you <span style="color:red">**I feel like I’m not alone**</span> with the daily CRM struggles…

{{% notice note "Fun fact" %}}
Since we added <button id="crmtipRouletteButton" title="Tip roulette: press it to get an absolutely random tip" style="margin-top:0px;">Get a random tip</button> button to the site, people on average started spending **23%** more time on the site. [Don't make me think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758) is another key!{{% /notice %}}

## Future

The one thing that seems to be lost in cohort effort is the individual identity. We didn't know and we didn't care or didn't think about it much. 

We did chat about it on [CRM MVP Podcast](http://crmmvppodcast.com/episode-55-building-your-personal-brand-like-an-mvp)

## Lessons learned

* Decide on your channels from day one. Go where your audience is. Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, local Walmart, whatever.
* If you're blogging try to stay away from syndication. It is very tempting to say `yes` to the requests, especially when they are coming from the community site moderator at Microsoft. If your content is valuable, *they* will get the traffic, not you. Yes, there is `<!-- more -->` trick but it could be seen by some as clickbait.
* Be consistent. 
* Commit 
* Invest into your undertaking. If it's a blog, get a domain name, iknoweverythingaboutcrm.blogspot.com ain't that exciting. Get SSL certificate, get some decent theme, perhaps spend $5 on fiverr.com and get yourself a logo.
* Spend on social

## The new beginning

## Advice

I don't like  

> MVP status should be an *award* not an *achievement*. It's a *milestone* not a *finish line*.

It's not a mountain peak it's a journey

* Do what you do. Regardless.
* Be yourself. Keep your identity.
* Use your skills
* Try something new and exciting.
